                    <p>At United Concordia Dental, we know that oral health is about much more than a smile. It’s about the connection between oral and overall wellness and delivering reduced costs. </p>

                        <p>In 2012, we presented our landmark study to a
                            scientific audience and started on our corporate
                            wellness journey. In this study,<sup>1</sup> United Concordia Dental
                            partnered with Highmark Inc. and respected
                            researcher Marjorie Jeffcoat, D.M.D., professor and
                            dean emeritus at the University of Pennsylvania School of Dental Medicine, to
                            examine an initial database of more than 1.7 million patients who had both
                            medical and dental insurance during a three-year period. The results of this
                            landmark study showed a critical connection between the health of the
                            mouth and the overall health of the body, and the significant medical cost
                            savings that can be achieved when patients with certain chronic conditions,
                            such as diabetes, receive ongoing treatment and maintenance for gum disease.
                            We believe the results underscore the critical need for an integrated approach
                            to wellness through better coordination between dental and medical providers.</p>
