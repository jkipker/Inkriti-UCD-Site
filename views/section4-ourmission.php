            Increasingly, reputable research indicates a connection
            between <strong>good oral health and overall health</strong>. Costly
            medical conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, preterm birth, kidney disease and dementia can be improved by maintaining good oral health.

             <p>In 2014, we followed up with additional research published in the <i>American Journal of Preventive Medicine.</i> This new research continues to show that significant cost savings and reduced hospitalizations are possible when consumers with other medical conditions, like heart disease or stroke, or who are pregnant,  effectively treat their gum disease.<sup>3</sup> Drawing on five years of data, these new findings look at the amount of savings possible when individuals with more than one chronic condition treat their gum disease. With additional data and further analysis, we can clearly show a significant decrease in annual medical costs and decreased hospitalizations visits when people with these diseases treat and manage their oral health.</p>

                    with United Concordia Dental and Highmark Inc. This
                    study shows reduced hospitalizations and health care
                    costs are possible when individuals with at least one
                    chronic condition or who are pregnant receive treatment
                    for their gum disease. Having the study peer-reviewed
