                    <p><strong>As we look back at the past year,</strong> it will always stand out as one that further changed who we are as a company. Itâ€™s not something hastily done or easily accomplished, but something each of us at United Concordia believes is truly necessary if we are to succeed at taking our company and our industry to the next level, and meet the ever-changing needs of our customers.</p>

                    <p>We enjoyed another strong financial year, ensuring we have the resources we need to move forward, impact lives and help members improve their oral and overall health like never before.</p>

                    <p>We took a deeper dive into the research from our landmark 2012 study<sup>2</sup> and built on earlier findings that clearly illustrate the connection between the health of the mouth and the health of the body. This research further demonstrates the significant medical cost savings possible when individuals with gum disease receive and maintain treatment. This insight continues to inspire us and drive our efforts to develop new ways to share this important story and ensure consumers become more active in their own oral health care.</p>

                    <p>We continued to build our nationwide network of dentists, added to our range of cost-effective and responsive plans and programs,  enhanced our website and created simpler ways for members to engage with us. We also developed strategic health partnerships, created an award-winning mobile app and strengthened our position as an industry leader.</p>

                  <p>For all of us at United Concordia, 2013 was an exciting year, but the momentum we generated is only the beginning of a mission that will carry us far into the future as we continue to build awareness, provide education and do all we can to ensure that people everywhere understand the important connection between oral health and overall wellness.
