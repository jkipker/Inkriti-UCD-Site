                    <p><strong>A lot can change during the course of a year.</strong> In 2013, we channeled our energy on becoming a consumer-centric company focused on the important connection between oral and overall health. By focusing on data-driven decisions, accountability and result inclusiveness and innovation, <strong>we are working to establish United Concordia as a leading, non-traditional dental wellness company.</strong> Based on new results from the research gathered and reported in our landmark study of 2012,<sup>1</sup> we started another chapter in our history—seeking new ways to share the message that a healthier mouth and a healthier body go hand-in-hand, and helping guide consumers to better overall wellness.</p>

                    <p>We’ve developed and implemented new ways to share information, created new products and services targeted more clearly to differing client needs and affordability, and worked to enhance our partnerships with our dentists—making major strides toward our important and exciting transformation.</p>

                    <p>Through enhanced interaction and coordination between dentists and doctors, <strong>we can lower costs, promote overall health and deliver real savings.</strong></p>

                    <p>By engaging with consumers through targeted communication, education and treatment, we’re helping them see us as partners in their journey to overall wellness.</p>
                    <p>
United Concordia Dental created a lot of momentum in 2013— generating more than 600,000 new members in our first year focused on oral health and overall wellness. This is only the beginning of a mission that will carry us far into the future, as we continue to build awareness, provide education and do all we can to ensure that people everywhere understand the important connection between oral health and overall wellness.</p><p>
We’re excited about the challenges of the years ahead. As we heighten our commitment to taking our company and industry to the next level, we are solidifying our strategic move from dental insurer to a non-traditional dental wellness company unlike any other.
